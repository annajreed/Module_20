For this assignment, we took the original dataset and created a test and train sample of that data to test our Logistic Regression model. This was to determine whether the model could accurately predict whether a borrower would be labeled as low-risk or high-risk. Overall, this model had the following results:
 * Accuracy score: 99.2%
 * Precision score for healthy loans: 100%
 * Precision score for high-risk loans: 85%
 * Recall score for healthy loans: 99%
 * Recall score for low-risk loans: 91%

This model showed that is was very good at predicting healthy loans but less accurate at predicting high-risk loans. Overall, this could be because the testing data set wasn't equally distributed so it had less data on high-risk loans for it to learn from. It could also be that more testing and tweaking of the model needs to be done. I would recommend that this model be used by this company because it has a very high accuracy score. I think because of that score and the recall scores being both above 90%, I think it's safe to use.
